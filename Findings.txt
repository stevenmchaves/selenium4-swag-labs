From the implementation of the two scenarios, I found 2 issues. They are related.
The execution of the tests were done on Chrome and Safari. I executed this on my Macbook.

1) The scenario 2 error message is incorrect. Either the test needs to be updated with
the correct error message OR the error message itself needs to be updated to match the
expectation of the test. If the error message was only 1 line like not entering the
Username or Password. The "Epic sadface:" is included for each error message.

Actual error message: Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out
Expected error message: Sorry, this user has been banned

2) The error message does not fit in the given error message container, which causes
the message be slightly concealed. This seems this is the case when you also pass in
the incorrect password. Possibly solution is to make the error container:
    a) auto-flex the height
    b) make the height large enough to fit the largest possible error message
    c) Choice a font that fits the given height of the error container.

Since this was a educational exercise.

I didn't consider the exposure of creds on the login page a bug. It is of course in real
life.

Google states that the credentials are compromised and should be changed.

I didn't check on Firefox. With more time, I would add the capability of the
WebDriverUtils with Docker, which the "io.github.bonigarcia.wdm.WebDriverManager"
has the many other capabilities.
